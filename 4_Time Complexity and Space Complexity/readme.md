4. Time complexity

Use of time complexity make it easy to estimate the running time of a program . Complexity can be viewed as the maximum nyumber of primitive operations that a program may execute.


 Space Complexity : Memory limits provide information about the expected space complexity. You can estimate the number of variable that you can declare in your programs.
